for number in range(10):
    print(f'The next number is {number}')


#If you want to increment the counter by more than the default value of 1, perhaps if you wanted only odd numbers
#or even numbers for example. To do this you add a third parameter to the range() function as shown below.


for number in range(1,10,2):
    print(f'The next number is {number}')
